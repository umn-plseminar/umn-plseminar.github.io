title = "2023-01-26 Talk: Algebraic effects"
+++

- *Speaker:* Nathan Guermond
- *Abstract:* The goal will be twofold, firstly to understand how to design algebraic effect handlers 
to model effects, and secondly to understand the relationship between monads and 
algebraic effects. I will give plenty of examples including how to use the OCaml 
interface for effects.

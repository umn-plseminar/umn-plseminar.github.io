+++

- _Speaker:_ Nathan Guermond
- _Abstract:_ The goal will be twofold, firstly to understand how to design algebraic effect handlers 
to model effects, and secondly to understand the relationship between monads and 
algebraic effects. I will give plenty of examples including how to use the OCaml 
interface for effects.

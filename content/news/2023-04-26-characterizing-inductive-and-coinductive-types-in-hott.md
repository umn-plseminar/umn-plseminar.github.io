title = "2023-04-26 Talk: Characterizing inductive and coinductive types in HoTT"
+++

- _Speaker:_ Perry Hart
- _Abstract:_ In this talk, we describe general inductive types in homotopy type theory as initial algebras of suitable 
endofunctors on the universe of types. We then describe coinductive types as terminal coalgebras of 
such endofunctors.

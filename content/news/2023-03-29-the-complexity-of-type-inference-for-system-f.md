title = "2023-03-29 Talk: The complexity of type inference for System F"
+++

- _Speaker:_ Perry Hart
- _Abstract:_ In 1991, Henglein and Mairson proved that recognizing typable terms in System F requires 
exponential time. They also proved that the complexity of this problem for higher-order extensions of 
System F is even worse. This talk presents a summary of their fascinating proof of these results.

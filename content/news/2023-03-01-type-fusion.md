+++

- _Speaker:_ Zhuyang Wang
- _Abstract:_ When are two types isomorphic? Type fusion provides us a convenient way to prove the isomorphism between two (co)inductive types. In this talk, I'll first introduce the basic rules to reason isomorphically on types. Then I'll show the type fusion law(s) and a few examples which would be hard to prove without these laws. If time permits, we could go through the proof of the laws.

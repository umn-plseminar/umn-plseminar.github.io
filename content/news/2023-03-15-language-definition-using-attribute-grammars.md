title = "2023-03-15 Talk: Language Definition Using Attribute Grammars"
+++

- _Speaker:_ Dawn Michaelson
- _Abstract:_ Attribute grammars, originally presented by Donald Knuth in 1968, can be used to specify the semantics of languages by associating semantic attributes with nodes in a syntax tree.  This talk will cover the basics of using attribute grammars to specify languages.  We will also discuss how attribute computation takes place when using an attribute grammar as a runnable language specification.
- _Location:_ Keller 2-225

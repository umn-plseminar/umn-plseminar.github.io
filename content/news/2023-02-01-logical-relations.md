title = "2023-02-01 Talk: Logical Relations"
+++

- _Speaker:_ Perry Hart
- _Abstract:_ We introduce a method of proof called logical relations, which has been useful for proving fundamental properties of programming-inspired type systems. This talk will illustrate logical relations by looking at proofs of two such properties. The first is strong normalizability of STLC. The second is that in System F, every polymorphic function that has the same type signature as the identity is actually equivalent to the identity. Fortunately, logical relations provide us with accessible proofs of these properties.

{{< section "About" >}}

This web page is intended to provide a loose organization to activities related to programming languages at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
Work in this area is mainly carried out within the research groups of professors [Favonia](https://favonia.org/), [Gopalan Nadathur](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~ngopalan/) and [Eric Van Wyk](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~evw/).

You can volunteer to give a talk at a future meeting by using the [sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qgb5VmGJnYqSmObNKrG46jf4uMUFPTIkmpbeBpoXCVo). Simply put your name and the date on which you'd like to give a talk.

If you are interested in participating but have just stumbled on this page, feel free to attend the next meeting.
You may also want to join the PL Seminar mailing list to stay informed about news of meetings.
